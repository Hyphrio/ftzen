# Figtree Zen

This is an edit of Figtree (https://github.com/erikdkennedy/figtree) for a
future branding project, with Figtree Black as the base.

## Caveats

This was edited from the binaries (Figtree-Black.otf) rather than the sources,
as editing the font source themselves requires Glyphs, which is as far as I can
tell is Mac only. This is instead created from FontForge GUI.
